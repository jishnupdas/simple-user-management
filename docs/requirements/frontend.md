# React Frontend Challenge

## The Challenge

### The flow

- Please follow the designs provided below for the challenge
- Create a view which lists out Users
- Upon clicking the delete icon the user must be deleted from the list
- Clicking on `Create User` a modal must be presented to the user to create a new user
- There are two roles for users â€” `User` and `Admin`
- The role selection must be a select element
- Upon adding the new user, the list of users must reflect the change
- Clicking on an existing user, a modal with their details must be presented to the user to update details
- Upon updating the user details, it should also reflect in the list of users

### Things to keep in mind

- The challenge must be done in ReactJS only
- Design should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile browser.
- The final design should be identical to the designs provided
- TypeScript is not mandatory but would be great to have
- As a Bonus, it will be highly appreciated if you can also provide Javascript based unit tests for your front-end code
